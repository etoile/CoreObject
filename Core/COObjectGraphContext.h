/**
 * @group Core
 * @abstract 
 * An object graph that manages COObject instances (COObject instances can only 
 * exist inside a COObjectGraphContext). 
 *
 * @section Conceptual Model
 *
 * An object graph context is usually persistent (-branch is not nil), it 
 * manages the objects that represent the current branch state in memory, 
 * and tracks their changes between commits.
 *
 * It tracks which objects in the object graph have been modified, which is 
 * what allows CoreObject to commit deltas instead of writing a fullsnapshot 
 * of every object in the object graph on every commit.
 *
 * All the objects that belong to an object graph are called inner objects 
 * (including the root object), while objects in other object graphs are outer 
 * objects. A reference to an outer object is a cross-persistent root reference.
 * For a more in-depth discussion, see Cross Persistent References section in 
 * COPersistentRoot.
 *
 * @section Common Use Cases
 *
 * The most common use case would be to check whether the object graph contains 
 * changes with -hasChanges, and more rarely to revert to the last committed 
 * state with -discardAllChanges e.g. when the user cancels some input in a 
 * dialog.
 *
 * You rarely need to interact directly with COObjectGraphContext API, but 
 * object graph contexts are passed to COObject initializers to tell the new 
 * object to which context it belongs, see -[COObject initWithObjectGraphContext:].
 *
 * @section Item Graph Representation
 *
 * COObjectGraphContext implements the COItemGraph protocol which allows 
 * viewing the COObjectGraphContext in a semi-serialized form (as a set of 
 * COItem objects), as well as the -setItemGraph: method which allows 
 * deserializing a given graph of COItems (reusing existing COObject instances 
 * if possible).
 *
 * @section Transient Object Graph 
 *
 * To manage transient COObject instances, transient object graphs not bound to 
 * a branch or persistent root can be  created. You can use them to hold an 
 * object graph state easily recreated in code (at  launch time or on demand) 
 * without depending on an entire CoreObject stack (an editing context, a 
 * store etc.).
 *
 * With COItemGraph protocol, COObject instances can be moved or copied 
 * accross persistent and transient object graphs. 
 *
 * In CoreObject, outer references (accross persistent object graphs) must 
 * point to a root object. Between a persistent and a transient object graph, 
 * this limit doesn't hold, you can refer to multiple objects and not just the 
 * root object (the root object is optional in a transient object graph). 
 *
 * If a transient COObject refers to a persistent one, there is no need to 
 * observe COObjectGraphContextWillRelinquishObjectsNotification, since the 
 * relationship cache will automatically update the references.
 *
 * A transient object graph can be turned into a persistent one with 
 * -[COEditingContext insertNewPersistentRootWithRootObject:], where the 
 * argument is an arbitrary object from the transient object graph.
 *
 * @section Creation and Deletion
 *
 * Persistent object graph contexts are usually created indirectly, each time a 
 * persistent root or branch is created, and their object graph is accessed. 
 * For example, with -[COPersistentRoot objectGraphContext] and 
 * -[COBranch objectGraphContext].
 *
 * To create transient object graphs, use -init, 
 * -initWithModelDescriptionRepository:, or +objectGraphContext.
 *
 * A persistent object graph is deleted in the store, when the branch that owns 
 * it is deleted (see -[COBranch setDeleted:]). For transient object graphs, 
 * all their content is lost when they are deallocated.
 *
 * @section Object Equality
 *
 * COObjectGraphContext does not override -hash or -isEqual:, so an
 * object graph context is only considered equal to itself.
 *
 * To compare the contents of two COObjectGraphContext instances you can do:
 * COItemGraphEqualToItemGraph(ctx1, ctx2).
 *
 * See also Object Equality section in COEditingContext.
