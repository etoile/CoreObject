/**
 * @group Core
 * @abstract An editing context exposes an in-memory snapshot of a CoreObject 
 * store, allows the user to queue changes in memory and commit them atomically. 
 *
 * Its functionality is split across 5 main classes (there is a owner chain 
 * where each element owns the one just below in the list):
 *
 * <deflist>
 * <term>COEditingContext</term><desc>Entry point for opening and creating stores.
 * Handles persistent root insertion and deletion</desc>
 * <term>COPersistentRoot</term><desc>Versioned sandbox of inner objects,
 * with a history graph (CORevision), and one or more branches (COBranch).</desc>
 * <term>COBranch</term><desc>A position on the history graph, with the revision
 * contents exposed as a COObjectGraphContext</desc>
 * <term>COObjectGraphContext</term><desc>manages COObject graph, tracks 
 * changes and handles reloading new states</desc>
 * <term>COObject</term><desc>Mutable inner object</desc>
 * </deflist>
 *
 * CORevision also fits this set although it is not directly owned by one object.
 *
 * @section Common Use Cases
 *
 * Typically COEditingContext is used at application startup to create or open 
 * a store (+contextWithURL:), when creating, deleting or accessing persistent 
 * roots, and to track and commit changes in all persistent roots.
 *
 * To create, delete or access persistent roots, see Creation and Deletion 
 * sections in COPersistentRoot documentation.
 *
 * @section Metamodel
 *
 * For all the persistent root inner objects, a valid entity description must 
 * exist in -[COEditingContext modelDescriptionRepository].
 *
 * The metamodel in the model description repository is passed downwards 
 * from the editing context to the object graph contexts that manages the inner 
 * objects (see -[COObjectGraphContext modelDescriptionRepository])
 *
 * To register a new entity description that describe a COObject subclass, 
 * override +[NSObject newEntityDescription], and COEditingContext will
 * automatically register it in
 * -[COEditingContext initWithStore:modelDescriptionRepository:].
 *
 * To register a new entity description without writing a COObject subclass, 
 * see ETModelDescriptionRepository documentation. To instantiate the correct 
 * inner objects or entities, those can be passed to 
 * -[COObject initWithEntityDescription:objectGraphContext:], as 
 * -insertNewPersistentRootWithEntityName: does. For more details about inner 
 * object initialization, see COObject.
 *
 * @section Change Tracking
 *
 * COEditingContext, COPersistentRoot, COBranch, and COObjectGraphContext 
 * tracks the uncommitted or pending changes in their persistent properties, 
 * and in their owned element among the 5 core classes (see the ownership list 
 * at the beginning of the overview).
 *
 * For the editing context, -hasChanges computes the current change 
 * tracking state based on its own changes and the changes in the persistent 
 * roots, -[COPersistentRoot hasChanges] is based on its own changes and the 
 * changes in the branches, and so on until reaching COObjectGraphContext. 
 * Take note that the same recursive model applies to -discardChanges.
 *
 * For pending changes, each class has a distinct change tracking API, but 
 * all declare the same basic methods: -hasChanges and -discardsChanges.
 * 
 * @section Object Equality
 *
 * COEditingContext, COPersistentRoot, COBranch, and COObjectGraphContext do 
 * not override -hash or -isEqual:, so instances of these classes are only
 * considered equal to the same instances.
 *
 * These classes form an in-memory view on a database, and the notion of two of 
 * these views being equal isn't useful or interesting.
 *
 * @section Commits and Undo
 *
 * In the current implementation, all changes made in a COEditingContext are
 * committed atomically in one SQLite transaction. However, when you consider 
 * CoreObject as a version control system, atomicity only exists per-persistent 
 * root, since persistent roots are the units of versioning and each can be 
 * manipulated independently (rolled back, etc.).
 *
 * For committing changes, see -commitWithIdentifier:metadata:undoTrack:error: 
 * and other similar commit methods. Take note that COCommitDescriptor provides 
 * support to localize the commit metadata.
 *
 * For recording these commits as undoable actions, see COUndoTrack. CoreObject 
 * supports two undo/redo models that both conform to the COTrack protocol: 
 * 
 * <list>
 * <item>a branch undo/redo model, that moves the current revision pointer on 
 * the branch path (this model cannot undo/redo commits involving changes that 
 * don't create a new revision, or span several persistent roots or 
 * branches)</item>
 * <item>a rich undo/redo model based on recording commits on an undo track 
 * (and even aggregating commits accross multiple undo tracks)</item>
 * </list>
 *
 * In most cases, to support undo/redo in an application, use a COUndoTrack. 
 * Branch undo/redo can be used to inspect and navigate a single persistent 
 * root history (e.g. in a timeline UI presenting a document history).
