/**
 * @group Undo
 * @abstract A specialized store to persist undo tracks.
 *
 * @section Conceptual Model
 *
 * If you intend to share a CoreObject store with multiple applications, the 
 * default undo track store should be used, otherwise it's usually better to
 * use an undo track store that remains private to your application.
 *
 * With a private undo track store, the history can be backed up and compacted 
 * without worrying about other applications.
 *
 * With the default undo track store, you cannot replace the database on disk 
 * at run-time and reload the instance returned by +[COUndoTrackStore defaultStore], 
 * since other applications can be using it.
 *
 * @section Current Limitations
 *
 * For now, COUndoTrackStore doesn't post distributed notifications, so undo 
 * tracks have no way to observe multiple instances of the same store 
 * (COUndoTrackStore objects initialized with the same URL). This means 
 * COUndoTrack will only track changes posted by the undo track store instance
 * of their editing context.
 *
 * For the default undo track store, all CoreObject applications must link
 * CoreObject versions whose COUndoTrackStore schema versions are identical.
