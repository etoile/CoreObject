/** 
 * @group Undo
 * @abstract A compaction strategy that targets the history located in the undo
 * track tail or outside the undo track.
 *
 * @section Conceptual Model
 *
 * This strategy ensures that an undo track will continue to work flawlessly 
 * for all operations (undo, redo, selective undo, set current node etc.), even 
 * after compacting the history in the store.
 *
 * The undo track tail can be cut, but the remaing part up to the head will
 * be kept intact, as explained in -initWithUndoTrack:upToCommand:.
 *
 * Revisions, persistent roots and branches referenced by other undo tracks or
 * none are not protected by this strategy. This means you must be careful not 
 * to break other undo tracks, when you are using multiple ones.
 *
 * @section Common Use Cases
 *
 * The most common use case is when you want to free space in a CoreObject store.
 *
 * Before passing the compaction strategy to -[COSQLiteStore compactHistory:], 
 * you must always call -compute.
 *
 * For now, COUndoTrackHistoryCompaction is not thread-safe.
 *
 * @section Pattern Undo Track
 *
 * You can pass a pattern undo track to the initalizer, then the compaction 
 * can discard any commands on child tracks, up to the pattern track current
 * node.
