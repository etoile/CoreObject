/** 
 * @group Undo
 * @abstract COTrack is a protocol to present changes on a timeline, 
 * manipulate them, and provide a custom view on the store history
 *
 * A track represents usually a revision or commit sequence, but it is up to the 
 * class adopting the protocol to decide about the sequence content (the track 
 * nodes). What constitutes a change from the track standpoint is thus under 
 * the track class responsability. COTrack requires the presented changes to be 
 * objects that conform to COTrackNode. All nodes on a track must also be of 
 * the same kind.
 *
 * @section Built-in Tracks
 *
 * In CoreObject, CORevision and COCommand conform to this track node protocol, 
 * and COBranch and COUndoTrack are track classes that present respectively 
 * revisions and commits as track nodes. 
 *
 * @section Persistency
 *
 * A track content can be persistent (e.g. a normal undo track or a branch) or 
 * lazily constructed (e.g. a pattern undo track, see 
 * +[COUndoTrack trackForPattern:withContext:]).
 *
 * @section Track Node Collection 
 *
 * The track protocol is split in several parts, the core part implements the 
 * logic to navigate track node collection: -nodes, -nextNodeOnTrackFrom:backwards:, 
 * -currentNode and -setCurrentNode:.
 *
 * You should implement these methods first, and then the other methods.
 *
 * A track must also implement ETCollection support based on the core method 
 * listed above.
 *
 * @section Basic Undo and Redo
 *
 * Another part in the protocol is the basic Undo and Redo support that makes 
 * possible to move the current node accross the node collection, and 
 * interprets this move as an undo/redo action.
 *
 * -undo and -redo should usually move the current node in a linear way, but 
 * there is no hard requirements on this point.
 *
 * @section Selective Undo
 *
 * All tracks must also implement -undoNode: and -redoNode: to support selective 
 * undo and redo, which usually move the current node in a non-linear way 
 * unlike -undo and -redo.
 *
 * A selective undo means undoing a single action in the past, while keeping 
 * the more recent actions that depend on the undone one. A normal undo can be 
 * seen as a selective undo subcase where the undone action is the most recent 
 * one. The main difference lies in the fact, a selective undo usually requires 
 * to make a new commit that discards the undone changes while keeping the 
 * other changes that follow on the track. To compute this new commit, -undoNode: 
 * and -redoNode: can leverage the Diff API or some API built on top of it 
 * (e.g. -[COCommand inverse]).
