/**
 * Goals for the app level undo system:
 *
 *  - Support use cases listed in TODO with one API/implementation
 *  - Stay as decoupled as possible from the rest of CoreObject
 *  - Easy for applications to extend with their own undo actions for manipulating
 *    state not managed by CoreObject. (Ideally all state would be tracked by
 *    CoreObject, but I felt this goal would improve the design anyway.)
 *
 * The concept behind the app-level undo system is, there is a per-user database
 * (separate from any CoreObject stores) that stores the user's undo/redo tracks.
 * (stored in ~/Library/CoreObject/Undo/undo.sqlite)
 *
 * When saving a batch of changes with a COEditingContext, you can optionally
 * record the edits in an undo track, by using one of the commit methods that takes
 * a COUndoTrack.
 *
 * The undo track database (COUndoTrackStore) stores a tree of serialized COCommandGroup objects
 * per track. Tracks are identified by their name (just a flat string); we may want to have suggested
 * naming schemes. Examples could be:
 *
 * "<application id>" -- for apps using one undo track for several persistent roots
 * "<application id>:<persistent root UUID>" -- for apps using one undo track per persistent root
 * "<application id>:<persistent root UUID>@username" -- for collaborative editing
 * "<application id>:<persistent root UUID>:<tab/pane name>" -- for a multipane editor
 *
 * Importantly, the names are just treated as opaque identifiers to CoreObject,
 * and the behaviour comes from which edits apps put on which tracks.
 *
 * This design should support all of these use-cases:
 *
 *  - per-window/tab/pane undo tracks when editing a single persistent root
 *    (e.g. for a graphics editor with split views editing two different parts
 *     of a a document, each pane can have its own undo track)
 *
 *  - per-app undo track for a manager application editing many persistent roots
 *
 *  - per-user undo tracks when editing a shared document.
