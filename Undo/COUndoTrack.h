/**
 * @group Undo
 * @abstract An undo track represents a history track that can record commits 
 * selectively. 
 *
 * For a commit done in an editing context, an undo track can be passed using 
 * -[COEditingContext commitWithIdentifier:metadata:undoTrack:error:] or 
 * similar commit methods. When the commit is saved, the editing context 
 * records the commit as a command using -recordCommand:. At this point, the 
 * undo track saves the command on disk.
 *
 * Commits that contain object graph context changes result in new revisions in 
 * the store. For other commits that just contain store structure changes:
 *
 * <list>
 * <item>branch creation</item>
 * <item>branch deletion</item>
 * <item>branch undeletion</item>
 * <item>branch switch</item>
 * <item>branch revision change</item>
 * <item>branch metadata editing (e.g. branch renaming)</item>
 * <item>persistent root creation</item>
 * <item>persistent root deletion</item>
 * <item>persistent root undeletion</item>
 * </list>
 *
 * no new revisions is created. The store doesn't record them in any way.
 *
 * However an undo track can track both: 
 * 
 * <list>
 * <item>store structure history (represented as custom commands e.g. 
 * COCommandDeleteBranch etc.)</item>
 * <item>branch history (new revisions represented as 
 * COCommandSetVersionForBranch)</item>
 * </list>
 *
 * Undo tracks can track all these changes or a subset per application or per 
 * use cases, and provide undo/redo support. For undo/redo menu actions, never 
 * manipulate the branch history directly, but use an undo track.
 *
 * You can navigate the command sequence to change the editing context state 
 * using -undo, -redo and -setCurrentNode:. COUndoTrack supports the same 
 * history navigation protocol than COBranch. Note that the COUndoTrack 
 * implementation (of these COTrack methods) can perform an editing context 
 * commit automatically.
 *
 * You shouldn't subclass COUndoTrack.
