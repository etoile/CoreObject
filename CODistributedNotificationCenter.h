/**
 * @group Utilities
 * @abstract Distributed notification center compatible with sandboxing.
 * 
 * When sandboxing is enabled, posting a distributed notification results 
 * in a normal notification.
 *
 * For non-sandboxed applications on macOS, we use 
 * NSDistributedNotificationCenter to keep multiple store instances (using the 
 * same UUID) in sync, accross processes and inside the current process. For 
 * sandboxed applications on iOS or macOS, this is the same, except we don't 
 * support the 'accross processes' case.
 * 
 * We cannot ignore distributed notifications in a sandboxed app, because we 
 * support keeping in sync two editing contexts backed by two distinct stores 
 * objects with the same UUID.
 *
 * See also COSQLiteStore and COUndoTrackStore.
