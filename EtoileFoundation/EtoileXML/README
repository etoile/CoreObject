Write an introduction to EtoileXML.

Mac OS X Support
----------------

You can build EtoileXML with the Xcode project of EtoileFoundation located in the parent directory.

Developer Notes
===============

EtoileXML links EtoileFoundation and not the reverse. From EtoileFoundation, it mainly uses ETSocket to support writing XML to a socket (see ETXMLSocketWriter).

For now, EtoileXML links the AppKit (known as gnustep-gui on GNUstep), we expect to move the classes that introduce this dependency elsewhere in the long run. You can compile EtoileXML without any AppKit dependency by excluding ETXMLXHTML-IMParser and NSAttributedString+HTML from the build.
