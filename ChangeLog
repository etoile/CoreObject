	Major rewrite of the Metadata server to use PostgreSQL for the Metadata DB
	instead of a dumb dictionary. This code isn't yet plugged into the rest of 
	CoreObject and the DB schema will surely evolve.
	Note: To run the test suite, you must first run setup-coreobject.sh script.
	* Headers/COMetadataServer.h:
	* COMetadataServer.m:
	* TestMetadataServer.m:
	Rewritten. Removed CORefRecord class.
	* GNUmakefile: Updated.
	* setup-coreobject.sh: Added.

	(-[ETUUID isFault]): New method.
	* COSerializer.m (-storeObjectFromAddress:withName:): 
	* CODeserializer.m (-loadUUID:withName:):
	New methods that patch ETSerializer and ETDeserializer, to be moved back 
	into EtoileSerialize once stabilised.
	(+[ETSerializer defaultLibraryURL]): Modified to provide a hook for a 
	testing specific library URL.
	* TestSerializer.m 
	(+[ETSerializer libraryURLForTest]): New method to put persistent objects 
	created by tests outside of the main CoreObject library.

2008-08-06 Quentin Mathe <qmathe@club-internet.fr>

	* Headers/COUtility.h: Modified RECORD macro to bypass persistency if 
	temporarily disabled.
	* Headers/COObject.h:
	* COObject.m:
	New ivar _isPersistencyEnabled.
	(-init): Tweaked to currently non-persistent objects by default and register 
	the receiver in the object context only if persistency has been turned on.
	(-enablePersistency, -disablePersistency): Added.
	(-serialize:using:, -deserialize:fromPointer:version:): Modified so 
	_isPersistencyEnabled doesn't get serialized.
	(-managedMethodNames): Added.
	* Headers/COGroup.h:
	* COGroup.m:
	(-managedMethodNames): Added.
	(-init):  Updated to disable persistency during initialization.

	* COFileObject.m:
	* COCollection.m:
	(-serialize:using:, -deserialize:fromPointer:version:): Added.

2008-08-04 Quentin Mathe <qmathe@club-internet.fr>

	Finished to clean up and test basic features of COObjectContext (object 
	space/plane-like persistency to be shared by CoreObject data model and 
	COProxy). This code extracted and modularized from COProxy now works as 
	expected. COGroup persistency and advanced features like replacing an object 
	by another temporal instance in a CoreObject graph aren't implemented yet.
	WARNING: Unstable API, do not use.
	* Headers/COObject.h:
	* COObject.m:
	New ivar _objectVersion.
	(+automaticallyMakeNewInstancesPersistent, 
	+setAutomaticallyMakeNewInstancesPersistent:, 
	-objectContext, 
	-objectVersion, -_setObjectVersion:, -lastObjectVersion, -isPersistent, 
	-save,

	-version): New ETSerializer category methods.
	* Headers/CODeserializer.h:
	* CODeserializer.m:
	(+defaultCoreObjectDeserializer, +deserializerObjectWithURL:): 
	New ETDeserializer category methods.
	* Headers/COObjectContext.h:
	* COObjectContext.m:

	Modified to return ready-to-use serializers set up by 
	ETSerializer(COSerializer). 
	(-lastSnapshotOfObject:forVersion:snapshotVersion:): Fixed to really 
	deserialize the last snapshot before the given version and not just the 
	last snapshot. Also modified to update the object version of the returned 
	instance.
	(-playbackInvocations:fromVersion:toVersion:): Modified to update the object 
	version of the returned instance.
	(-recordInvocation:): Modified to return the object version incremented or 
	not on return, this allows to know whether the invocation was recorded or 
	not. Fixed to return at the right time when an invocation doesn't have to 
	be recorded (record stack not empty). Added a check to be sure the target 
	belongs to the context.
	(-serializeInvocation:): Modified to handle object versions. Fixed to 
	correctly increment and retrieve the version bound to the delta serializer. 
	Added code to take a BaseVersion snapshot on first invocation record. Added 
	some assertion checks.
	(-logInvocation:recordVersion:): Modified to increment the context version.

	* Source/COGroup.m (+objectWithURL:):
	* Source/CODirectory.m (+objectWithURL:):
	Fixed warnings in COObjectServer by declaring +objectWithURL in COGroup 
	protocol.

2008-05-25 Quentin Mathe <qmathe@club-internet.fr>

	Improved the filesystem backend to work as expected with EtoileUI, mainly by
	cleanly exporting metadatas as properties, supporting to test whether a URL 
	references a group or not, and properly turning pick and drop operations 
	into filesystem operations through ETCollectionMutation.
	* Headers/COGroup.h:
	* COGroup.m:
	Modified COGroup protocol to conform to ETCollectionMutation.
	(-insertObject:atIndex:): New method (to be conform to ETCollectionMutation).

	not declared in metadatas.
	(-properties): Fixed to expose metadatas as properties.
	(-setURL:): Improved to raise an exception if the URL doesn't reference a 
	file.

2008-05-20 Quentin Mathe <qmathe@club-internet.fr>

	conformance.
	(-hash, -isEqual:): Fixed type declarations to match NSObject API.
	* Headers/COGroup.h:
	* COGroup.m:
	Modified COGroup class to conform to COGroup protocol.

	* COObject.m (-serialize:using:, -deserialize:fromPointer:version:): New 
	methods to handle the serialization of managed core objects (ETSerializable 
	informal protocol).

2008-04-27 Quentin Mathe <qmathe@club-internet.fr>

	convenient core object factory and a shared cache of all core objects in 
	memory for all related core object contexts.

	Added.
	* GNUmakefile: Updated.

	* GNUmakefile: Updated.

2008-04-22 Quentin Mathe <qmathe@club-internet.fr>

	Written some basic serialization tests and ensured COObjectContext doesn't 
	break the existing code. All tests pass but one (NSNumber issue, may be 
	GNUstep-related).
	* COObjectContext.m:
	(+defaultContext): Fixed the incorrect release of the default context that 
	lead to a crash.
	(-recordInvocation:): Tweaked to always push objects on the recorded objects 
	stack and documented. This fix a crash occuring in -endRecord trying to

	(-setValue:forProperty:):
	(-valueForProperty:):
	Modified to use the new recording macros (several other methods will have to 
	be modified).
	* Headers/NSObject+CoreObject.h: Extended COManagedObject protocol to 
	exploit the new managed object context (API needs work). Modified -UUID 
	return type to be an ETUUID value object instead of an NSString.
	* NSObject+CoreObject.m: Minor import change to compile.
	* Headers/COSerializer.h:
	* Headers/CODeserializer.h:
	* COSerializer.m:
	* CODeserializer.m:
	Rewritten to be useful in a different way now that most of their old logic 
	has been moved to EtoileSerialize. Now encapsulates the interaction details 
	with EtoileSerialize.
	* Headers/CoreObject.h: Renenabled serializer classes.
	* GNUmakefile: Updated.

2008-04-15  Quentin Mathe <qmathe@club-internet.fr>

	Fixed compilation with EtoileSerialize trunk version.
	* Headers/CoreObject.h:
	* GNUmakefile: 
	Disabled COSerializer and CODeserializer which aren't needed immediately 
	because EtoileSerialize now provides most of their features in their parent 
	classes.

2008-04-15  Quentin Mathe <qmathe@club-internet.fr>

	WARNING: Doesn't compile with the trunk version of EtoileSerialize.
	* Headers/COProxy.h:
	* COProxy.m:
	Added by copying them from EtoileSerialize.

2008-04-07  Quentin Mathe <qmathe@club-internet.fr>

	offered by EtoileFoundation.
	WARNING: May not compile with the trunk version of EtoileSerialize.
	* UUID:

	ensure copy works as advertised).
	* COFile.m:.
	Fixed -URL to return an autoreleased copy as expected for such value object.
	* CODirectory.m
	(-addObject:, -addSymbolicLink:, -addHardLink:, 
	-checkObjectToBeRemovedOrDeleted:): Corrected object validity boolean test.

	implements it.
	* Headers/COObject.h:
	* Headers/COGroup.h:

	* COFile.m:.
	* Headers/CODirectory.h:
	* CODirectory.m:.
	Added. These classes makes up the FS server backend that will be later moved
