	Fixed compilation with EtoileSerialize trunk version.
	* Headers/CoreObject.h:
	* GNUmakefile: 
	Disabled COSerializer and CODeserializer which aren't needed immediately 
	because EtoileSerialize now provides most of their features in their parent 
	classes.

	WARNING: Doesn't compile with the trunk version of EtoileSerialize.
	* Headers/COProxy.h:
	* COProxy.m:
	Added by copying them from EtoileSerialize.

	Removed existing UUID stuff from CoreObject in favor of the support now 
	offered by EtoileFoundation.
	WARNING: May not compile with the trunk version of EtoileSerialize.
	* UUID:
	* Headers/COUUID.h:
	* COUUID.m:
	Removed. We use ETUUID instead now.
	* Headers/CoreObject.h:
	* Headers/COObject.h:
	* Headers/COSerializer.h:
	* Headers/CODeserializer.h:
	* Source/COObject.m:

	* Headers/COGroup.h: Fixed COGroup protocol to inherit from COObject as 
	expected.

2008-03-21  Quentin Mathe <qmathe@club-internet.fr>

	Wrote tests that ensure file copy operation behaves correctly.
	* TestDirectory.m (-testCopyObject): Added.

2008-03-21  Quentin Mathe <qmathe@club-internet.fr>

	Fixed file move operation and probably copy too (have to write tests to 
	ensure copy works as advertised).
	* COFile.m:.
	Fixed -URL to return an autoreleased copy as expected for such value object.
	* CODirectory.m
	(-addObject:, -addSymbolicLink:, -addHardLink:, 
	-checkObjectToBeRemovedOrDeleted:): Corrected object validity boolean test.
	(-addCopiedObject, -addMovedObject:): Fixed destination path to match 
	NSFileManager expectation.
	* TestFile.m:
	* TestDirectory.m:
	Added new tests.

2008-03-20  Quentin Mathe <qmathe@club-internet.fr>

	Introduced a preliminary CoreObject protocol and a filesystem backend that
	implements it.
	* Headers/COObject.h:
	* Headers/COGroup.h:
	Added a rough CoreObject protocol that consists of COObject and COGroup
	protocols. COObject and COGroup classes don't yet conform to these.
	* Headers/COFile.h:
	* COFile.m:.
	* Headers/CODirectory.h:
	* CODirectory.m:.

	* Headers/CoreObject.h:
