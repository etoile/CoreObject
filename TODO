TODO

## EtoileSerialize ##

- Modify ETObjectStore represents an entire object including the branches and 
  not just a single branch.
- Modify ETObjectStore so that it lets us store some metadatas, for 
  ETObjectBundle an Info.plist along the branch directories would be fine.
- Better error reporting for nil or invalid URL at deserialization time, instead 
  of File NSMapTable.m: 364. In NSMapGet Nul table argument supplied
  See also -testResolveFaults in TestGroup.m and -objectWithURL:version: 
  (currently in COObjectServer).


## CoreObject ##

- Add a deletion model both for object contexts and in-store object 
  representations.
- Rewrote as much as possible of COMetadataServer to use SQLClient library 
  rather than libpq directly.
- History cleaning without breaking the possibility to restore a context to 
  a coherent state if the target version is still present in the global history 
  of the metadata DB.
- Possibility to create a non-persistent copy of a persistent instance.

## EtoileFoundation ##

- Add split object support that can be leveraged to handle the history of a 
  single object distinctly depending on whether it is loaded in an editor or 
  a manager. The editor alters the content (image data, sound data, compound 
  document structure) and optionally the properties/metadatas when the object 
  manager only alters the properties/metadatas. For now, CoreObject only 
  deals with versioning of the properties/metadatas. Take note that many kind 
  of objects such contacts or bookmarks only consist of properties/metadatas 
  (without content in a document sense).
